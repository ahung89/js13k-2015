## A drone game, made for the [JS13k game jam](http://js13kgames.com/).

The JS13k submitted version is [here](https://github.com/marycourtland/js13k-2015/tree/1bfc16f87ad79547bc71b17b7aadf4b37f6bab99). But development continues to march forward!

#### Controls:

A, D, S, W
Move the drone

Space
Control a human (takes a bit of time to succeed, and you must be in range)

Left, right
Move a controlled human

Down
Have the human pick up or drop an item

Up
Deliver an item (the drone must be close by)

#### Stats:

First meter: structural integrity - decreases when you're hit by a guard's bullet or hit by lightning

Second meter: energy - drains at a steady rate. Replenished with batteries.
